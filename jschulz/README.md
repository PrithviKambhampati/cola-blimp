	 This visage, no mere veneer of vanity, is a vestige of the vox populi,
now vacant, vanished. However, this valorous visitation of a by-gone vexation,
stands vivified and has vowed to vanquish these venal and virulent vermin 
vanguarding vice and vouchsafing the violently vicious and voracious violation of volition.
	-V
